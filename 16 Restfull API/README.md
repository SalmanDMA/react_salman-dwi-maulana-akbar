# React Fundamental

## Description

This is my sixteenth assignment in the Alterra program. The task I worked on is a React project that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using the mockApi API. The project aims to display product data on the browser and provide the ability to add, update, and delete the data.

In this project, I used React as the main framework to develop the user interface. The product data is obtained through the API provided by mockApi. Once the data is successfully retrieved, the project displays the list of available products in the form of cards on the browser.

## Main Features

- Creating new products using the "Create" feature.
- Displaying the list of existing products using the "Read" feature.
- Editing existing products using the "Update" feature.
- Deleting unnecessary products using the "Delete" feature.
- The project also includes data validation on the input form, ensuring that users fill in the data with the correct format before being able to add or update products. Error messages will be displayed if users input data in an invalid format.

## Technology

- React with the CRA Template

- Bootstrap
