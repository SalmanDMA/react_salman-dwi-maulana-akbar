# Final Project

## Keterangan

This is my last assignment in the Alterra program. Here I made a project with a mosque theme or something related to Islam. I put everything I have learned into this project. This project has 2 views, namely the admin view, which is used for CRUD operations, and theÂ user view, which can only see and follow the activities on the website. What is the appearance or flow of the website that I have created? You can visit it at the link that I have provided.
