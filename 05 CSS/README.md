# CSS

This is my fifth assignment from the Alterra program. This time, I am assigned to create two HTML files along with their CSS. For the first file, it should be a page displaying boxes in the shape of squares with sizes of 100 px and 350 px, respectively. For the second file, it should be a simple landing page that showcases a specific post from a website with a predetermined design.
