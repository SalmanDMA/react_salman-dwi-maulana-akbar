# Javascript Refresment

## Description

This is my seventh assignment for the Alterra program, focusing on JavaScript. In this assignment, I completed six tasks to test my understanding of JavaScript, such as displaying an array based on a specific index, modifying array values using specific methods, identifying the reasons for errors in the code, and displaying the appropriate output for each task.

## Technology

- Javascript

## Condition

Options you can choose to test the code :

- Web browsers Devtools (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- CLI (using node.js)

## How to Install

1. Clone this repository into your local directory.
2. Uncomment according to the desired number.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4. Open the console in your Web browsers Devtools.
5. Skip number 3 if you use the CLI (example: Node.js).
6. Type `node index.js` in your console.

### Happy Code Everyone!!!
