# Version Control and Branch Management

This is my second assignment from the Alterra Program, where the topic is about introducing me to the version control system, starting from its history, types, and the tools commonly used by developers. Specifically, I'm required to learn about Git and GitHub. I would also like to understand what Git and GitHub are and explain the commonly used Git commands, such as:

- git init
- git add
- git commit
- git pull
- git push
- git stash
- etc.

For the assignment itself, I was asked to try out these commands and resolve a conflict that arises when merging two branches.
