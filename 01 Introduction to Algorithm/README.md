# Introduction to Algorithm

This is my first assignment in the Alterra program, which introduces the concept of algorithms and how to create them. In this assignment, I was asked to create flowcharts for two different cases:

- Prime Numbers Case: I am tasked with creating a flowchart that can check whether a number is a prime number or not.
- Lights and Buttons Case: I am tasked with creating a flowchart that depicts the interaction between N buttons and a lamp, where the state of the lamp changes when specific buttons are pressed.
